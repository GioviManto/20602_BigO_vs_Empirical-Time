# 20602_BigO_vs_Empirical-Time
This research investigate two interesting questions that underscore how complex estimating the computing time of algorithms can be, comparing theory with practice.

- Answers.ipynb -> is the main file where you can see the whole research
- Questions_HW.pdf -> is the file where the two questions are asked and a compact answer is given for both
- Interpretation.pdf -> is an exhaustive explanation of Answers.ipynb
- Tests_on_Google_Colab.ipynb -> is the notebook where the test on Google Colab where made
- Merge_sort.py -> is the implementation of merge sort algorithm in python
- merge_sort.cpp -> is the implementation of merge sort algorithm in C++
- gaussian_elimination.py -> is the implementation of gaussian elimination algorithm in python
- gaussian_elimination.cpp -> is the implementation of gaussian elimination algorithm in C++
